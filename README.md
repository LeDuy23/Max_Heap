A **Max Heap** is a tree-based data structure where every parent node is **greater than or equal to** its child nodes. It's a core concept in data structures, commonly used in **priority queues**, **heap sort**, and scheduling systems.

This project walks through building a Max Heap **from scratch**, with clear explanations for each function and logic step â€” no copy-pasting, no skipping over the why.

##  Features Covered

- Array-based heap structure
-  `insert()` with up-heap bubbling
- `extractMax()` with down-heap trickling
-  Helper methods:
  - `getParent(index)`
  - `getLeftChild(index)`
  - `getRightChild(index)`
  - `swap(index1, index2)`
